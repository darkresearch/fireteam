</Tip>

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/darkresearch/fireteam.git
cd fireteam
```

### Step 2: Run Setup Script

Fireteam includes an automated setup script that:
- Creates necessary directories
- Installs the CLI tools to `~/.local/bin`
- Sets up the environment

```bash
bash setup.sh
```

The setup script will:
1. Create `state/` and `logs/` directories
2. Copy CLI tools (`start-agent`, `stop-agent`, `fireteam-status`) to `~/.local/bin`
3. Make the tools executable
4. Verify the installation

### Step 3: Update Your PATH

If `~/.local/bin` isn't already in your PATH, add it:

```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

For macOS using zsh:

```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables (Optional)

Create a `.env` file in the Fireteam directory:

```bash
cd /home/claude/fireteam
nano .env
```

Add your configuration:

```bash
# Git configuration
GIT_USER_NAME="Your Name"
GIT_USER_EMAIL="your.email@example.com"

# Optional: Sudo password for system-level operations
# SUDO_PASSWORD=your_password_here
```

<Warning>
Never commit your `.env` file to version control. It's already in `.gitignore`.
</Warning>

### Step 5: Verify Installation

Check that the CLI tools are accessible:

```bash
which fireteam-status
# Should output: /home/your-username/.local/bin/fireteam-status

fireteam-status
# Should output: No active Fireteam session found.
```

## Your First Project

Let's build a Bitcoin price checker CLI tool - a real-world project that Fireteam completed at 98% in just 3 cycles during testing.

### Step 1: Start the Agent

```bash
start-agent --project-dir ~/bitcoin-cli --prompt "Build a Python CLI tool that fetches the current Bitcoin price from the CoinGecko API. Include error handling, retry logic, and formatted output. The tool should accept command-line arguments and display the price in USD."
```

<Tip>
Be specific in your goal description. Include desired features, error handling requirements, and output format.
</Tip>

### Step 2: Monitor Progress

In a separate terminal, watch the progress in real-time:

```bash
fireteam-status --watch
```

You'll see output like:

```
╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║                    🔥 FIRETEAM STATUS 🔥                     ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

Status: ⚡ RUNNING

Project Information:
  Directory: /home/user/bitcoin-cli
  Branch: agent-20251017-143022
  Goal: Build a Python CLI tool that fetches the current Bitcoin...

Current Progress:
  Cycle: 2
  Phase: Executing
  Completion: 95%
  Validation: 0/3 checks

Last Updated: 2025-10-17 14:35:42
```

### Step 3: Understanding the Cycle

Watch as Fireteam goes through each cycle:

**Cycle 0 - Initial Build**
- **Planning**: Analyzes goal, creates project structure plan
- **Execution**: Implements core functionality, API integration, CLI
- **Review**: Tests the implementation → 88% complete

**Cycle 1 - Refinement**
- **Planning**: Reviews gaps, plans improvements
- **Execution**: Adds error handling, retry logic, better output
- **Review**: Tests enhanced version → 95% complete (validation 1/3)

**Cycle 2 - Validation**
- **Planning**: Critical review of remaining gaps
- **Execution**: Adds documentation, edge case handling
- **Review**: Comprehensive test → 98% complete (validation 2/3)

**Cycle 3 - Final Validation**
- **Review**: Final verification → 98% complete (validation 3/3)
- **Complete!** 🎉

<Info>
Fireteam requires **3 consecutive reviews ≥95%** to ensure quality. A single high score isn't enough.
</Info>

### Step 4: Check the Results

Once complete, explore your new project:

```bash
cd ~/bitcoin-cli
ls -la
```

You'll find:
- **Source code**: `bitcoin_cli.py` or similar
- **Tests**: `test_bitcoin_cli.py`
- **Documentation**: `README.md` with usage instructions
- **Git history**: Complete commit log of all changes
- **Requirements**: `requirements.txt` with dependencies

Test the CLI:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the tool
python bitcoin_cli.py
```

### Step 5: Explore the Git History

Every cycle creates automatic commits:

```bash
git log --oneline
```

Output:
```
a3f8b2c Cycle 3: Final validation - Documentation polish
e7d9a1b Cycle 2: Enhanced error handling and retry logic
4c2e8f0 Cycle 1: Refactored output formatting
b1a7d3e Cycle 0: Initial implementation with API integration
9f4e2a8 Initial commit - Fireteam project initialization
```

## What Just Happened?

Fireteam autonomously:

1. ✅ Created a complete Python CLI project structure
2. ✅ Implemented CoinGecko API integration
3. ✅ Added comprehensive error handling and retry logic
4. ✅ Created formatted console output
5. ✅ Wrote unit tests with good coverage
6. ✅ Generated complete documentation
7. ✅ Committed all changes to Git with descriptive messages
8. ✅ Validated the implementation through 3 review cycles

**All without human intervention after the initial goal.**

## Project Monitoring

### Real-Time Watching

Keep the `--watch` flag running to see live updates:

```bash
fireteam-status --watch
```

Updates every 3 seconds with current cycle, phase, and completion percentage.

### Detailed Logs

View full agent logs:

```bash
fireteam-status --logs
```

Shows the last 50 lines of orchestrator logs with detailed agent outputs.

### Follow Mode

Stream logs in real-time:

```bash
fireteam-status --follow
```

Perfect for debugging or watching the agents work.

## Stopping a Project

To gracefully stop Fireteam:

```bash
stop-agent
```

This:
- Sends a shutdown signal to the orchestrator
- Waits for the current agent to complete
- Saves the current state
- Commits any pending changes

<Warning>
Do not kill the process manually (`Ctrl+C` or `kill -9`). Always use `stop-agent` for graceful shutdown.
</Warning>

## Common First Project Ideas

Try these proven project ideas that work great with Fireteam:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Weather CLI" icon="cloud">
    **Goal**: "Build a Python CLI that fetches weather data from OpenWeatherMap API for any city"

    **Expected**: 95% in 2 cycles
  </Card>

  <Card title="Task Manager" icon="list-check">
    **Goal**: "Create a SQLite-based task manager CLI with CRUD operations"

    **Expected**: 92% in 1 cycle
  </Card>

  <Card title="Web Scraper" icon="spider">
    **Goal**: "Build a Python script to scrape Hacker News front page headlines using BeautifulSoup"

    **Expected**: 92% in 1 cycle
  </Card>

  <Card title="REST API" icon="server">
    **Goal**: "Create a FastAPI note-taking API with full CRUD endpoints and validation"

    **Expected**: 92% in 1 cycle
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Tips for Better Results

### Writing Effective Goals

<Tip>
**Good goals are specific, actionable, and include desired features.**
</Tip>

✅ **Good Example**:
```
Build a Python CLI calculator that supports basic arithmetic operations
(+, -, *, /), handles division by zero, accepts command-line arguments,
and provides helpful usage instructions.
```

❌ **Bad Example**:
```
Make a calculator
```

### Goal Best Practices

1. **Specify the language**: "Python CLI" or "TypeScript Node.js app"
2. **List key features**: API endpoints, error handling, data validation
3. **Mention tech stack**: FastAPI, SQLite, BeautifulSoup, etc.
4. **Include quality requirements**: Error handling, tests, documentation
5. **Be realistic**: Start with well-defined, medium-sized projects

### Optimal Project Complexity

**Sweet Spot**: Medium complexity, well-defined requirements
- CLI tools (100-300 lines)
- API clients with 3-5 endpoints
- Simple web scrapers
- CRUD applications with database

**Too Simple**: May complete too quickly for validation
- Single-function scripts
- Hello World programs

**Too Complex**: May require many cycles
- Full web applications with frontend
- Complex distributed systems
- Projects requiring multiple services

## Troubleshooting

### "Command not found: start-agent"

Your PATH isn't configured correctly. Add `~/.local/bin`:

```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### "Claude CLI not found"

Install the Claude CLI:

```bash
# Follow the official guide
# https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/installation
```

### "Permission denied" errors

Make CLI tools executable:

```bash
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/{start-agent,stop-agent,fireteam-status}
```

### Agent timeouts

Some projects need more time. Edit `config.py`:

```python
AGENT_TIMEOUTS = {
    "planner": 900,      # 15 minutes for complex planning
    "reviewer": 900,     # 15 minutes for thorough review
    "executor": 2400     # 40 minutes for large implementations
}
```
