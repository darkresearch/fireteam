## 🔧 Post-Deployment Configuration

### Analytics Setup (Optional)

The `mint.json` file includes a placeholder PostHog analytics key on line 130:
```json
"analytics": {
  "posthog": {
    "apiKey": "phc_placeholder_key_fireteam_docs"
  }
}
```

**Impact**: Analytics will not collect data with the placeholder key, but the site functions perfectly without it.

**To enable analytics after deployment:**

1. **Create PostHog account** at https://posthog.com
2. **Create a new project** for Fireteam Documentation
3. **Copy your API key** from project settings (format: `phc_...`)
4. **Update mint.json** line 130 with your real key:
   ```json
   "analytics": {
     "posthog": {
       "apiKey": "phc_YOUR_REAL_KEY_HERE"
     }
   }
   ```
5. **Commit and redeploy** to Mintlify

**Alternative**: If analytics are not needed, remove the entire `analytics` section from `mint.json`.

**Priority**: P3 - Optional feature, no impact on core functionality

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions
