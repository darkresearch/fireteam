# Execution Modes

Fireteam uses different execution strategies based on task complexity. Each mode balances thoroughness against efficiency.

## Mode Overview

```
SINGLE_TURN  →  Execute
SIMPLE       →  Execute
MODERATE     →  Execute → Review
FULL         →  Plan → Execute → Review (×3)
```

## SINGLE_TURN Mode

**For:** Trivial tasks like typo fixes, adding comments

**Behavior:**
- Single Claude SDK call
- Minimal tool access
- No review phase
- Fastest execution

```python
from fireteam import execute, ExecutionMode

result = await execute(
    project_dir="/path/to/project",
    goal="Fix the typo in README.md",
    mode=ExecutionMode.SINGLE_TURN,
)
```

## SIMPLE Mode

**For:** Self-contained tasks that don't require planning

**Behavior:**
- Execute phase only
- Full tool access (Read, Write, Edit, Bash)
- No review phase
- Quick execution

```python
result = await execute(
    project_dir="/path/to/project",
    goal="Add logging to the auth module",
    mode=ExecutionMode.SIMPLE,
)
```

## MODERATE Mode

**For:** Tasks requiring some verification

**Behavior:**
- Execute phase with full tools
- Single review phase afterward
- Extracts completion percentage
- Good balance of speed and quality

```python
result = await execute(
    project_dir="/path/to/project",
    goal="Refactor the user service",
    mode=ExecutionMode.MODERATE,
)

# Result includes review info
print(result.completion_percentage)  # e.g., 85
print(result.metadata.get("review"))  # Review output
```

## FULL Mode

**For:** Complex tasks requiring planning and validation

**Behavior:**
1. **Planning Phase**: Analyze goal, create implementation plan
2. **Execution Phase**: Implement the plan
3. **Validation Phase**: Multiple reviews until 3 consecutive >95% completion

```python
result = await execute(
    project_dir="/path/to/project",
    goal="Redesign the authentication system",
    mode=ExecutionMode.FULL,
)

# Result includes all phases
print(result.metadata.get("plan"))  # Implementation plan
print(result.metadata.get("review"))  # Final review
print(result.completion_percentage)  # Should be >95%
```

### Validation Requirements

FULL mode requires **3 consecutive reviews** scoring **>95%** completion before succeeding. This ensures:

- No premature completion
- Consistent quality across reviews
- Thorough verification of changes

If validation fails, the result will have `success=False` with an error explaining why.

## Mode Selection

### Automatic (Recommended)

Let Fireteam choose based on complexity estimation:

```python
result = await execute(
    project_dir="/path/to/project",
    goal="Your task here",
    # mode not specified - auto-detect
)

print(f"Used mode: {result.mode}")
```

### Manual Override

Force a specific mode:

```python
# Be thorough with a simple task
result = await execute(
    project_dir="/path/to/project",
    goal="Add a comment",
    mode=ExecutionMode.FULL,
)

# Be quick with a complex task (not recommended)
result = await execute(
    project_dir="/path/to/project",
    goal="Refactor everything",
    mode=ExecutionMode.SINGLE_TURN,
)
```

## Tool Access by Mode

| Mode | Read | Write | Edit | Bash | Glob | Grep |
|------|------|-------|------|------|------|------|
| SINGLE_TURN | Limited | Limited | Limited | No | No | No |
| SIMPLE | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| MODERATE | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| FULL | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |

Note: Planner and Reviewer phases in FULL mode have read-only access.
