# Complexity Estimation

Fireteam automatically estimates task complexity to select the appropriate execution strategy. This page explains how complexity estimation works.

## Complexity Levels

  <Card title="TRIVIAL" icon="feather">
    Single-line changes, typo fixes, adding comments
  </Card>
  <Card title="SIMPLE" icon="puzzle-piece">
    Self-contained changes, single-file modifications
  </Card>
  <Card title="MODERATE" icon="layer-group">
    Multi-file changes, requires some planning
  </Card>
  <Card title="COMPLEX" icon="diagram-project">
    Architectural changes, major refactoring
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How It Works

When you call `execute()` without specifying a mode, Fireteam:

1. Sends your goal and context to Claude
2. Claude analyzes the scope and returns a complexity level
3. Fireteam maps the complexity to an execution mode

```python
from fireteam import estimate_complexity

complexity = await estimate_complexity(
    goal="Add user authentication",
    context="Using FastAPI with existing User model",
)
# Returns: ComplexityLevel.MODERATE
```

## Complexity to Mode Mapping

| Complexity | Mode | Behavior |
|------------|------|----------|
| TRIVIAL | SINGLE_TURN | Single Claude call, minimal tools |
| SIMPLE | SIMPLE | Execute only, no review |
| MODERATE | MODERATE | Execute + single review |
| COMPLEX | FULL | Plan + execute + validation reviews |

## Classification Guidelines

### TRIVIAL Tasks

- Fix typos
- Add/remove comments
- Rename a single variable
- Simple formatting changes

### SIMPLE Tasks

- Implement a single function
- Add logging to existing code
- Fix a straightforward bug
- Update configuration values

### MODERATE Tasks

- Refactor a module
- Add a new feature with tests
- Fix a bug requiring investigation
- Update multiple related files

### COMPLEX Tasks

- Major architectural changes
- Implement new subsystems
- Large-scale refactoring
- Cross-cutting concerns

## Manual Override

You can bypass complexity estimation by specifying the mode directly:

```python
from fireteam import execute, ExecutionMode

# Force FULL mode for thorough execution
result = await execute(
    project_dir="/path/to/project",
    goal="Add simple logging",
    mode=ExecutionMode.FULL,  # Override complexity estimation
)
```

## Customizing Estimation

The complexity estimation uses a prompt that you can customize via `COMPLEXITY_PROMPT`:

```python
from fireteam.complexity import COMPLEXITY_PROMPT

# View the default prompt
print(COMPLEXITY_PROMPT)
```
