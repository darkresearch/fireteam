## Overview

Fireteam has undergone continuous improvement based on real-world testing and user feedback. This page documents completed enhancements, their impact, and ongoing improvement efforts.

## Completed Improvements

### 1. Configurable Agent Timeouts ✅

**Problem:** Fixed 5-minute planner and 10-minute executor timeouts caused failures on complex projects.

**Solution:** Made timeouts configurable in `config.py`:

```python
AGENT_TIMEOUTS = {
    "planner": 600,      # 10 minutes (was 5)
    "reviewer": 600,     # 10 minutes
    "executor": 1800     # 30 minutes (was 10)
}
```

**Impact:**
- Zero timeout failures in 11-project test suite
- GitHub Analyzer completed successfully (previously failed at Cycle 8)
- 100% success rate across diverse projects

**Status:** ✅ Implemented in config.py

### 2. Sudo Password Support ✅

**Problem:** Projects requiring system packages (Node.js, build tools) failed without passwordless sudo.

**Solution:** Added `SUDO_PASSWORD` environment variable:

```bash
# .env file
SUDO_PASSWORD=your_password_here
```

**Implementation:**

```python
# config.py
SUDO_PASSWORD = os.getenv("SUDO_PASSWORD", None)

def has_sudo_access():
    return SUDO_PASSWORD is not None
```

**Impact:**
- Prevents 5-10 wasted cycles on package installation
- GitHub Analyzer: Would have saved 8 cycles (~2 hours)
- Enables TypeScript/Node.js projects without manual setup

**Status:** ✅ Implemented and documented

### 3. Parse Failure Handling ✅

**Problem:** Reviewer output parse failures caused `completion_percentage = 0`, triggering unnecessary cycles.

**Example failure:**
```
Cycle 1: 92% → Parse failure → 0% → Wasted retry cycle
```

**Solution:** Use last known completion % on parse failures:

```python
def update_completion_percentage(parsed_value, logger):
    if parsed_value is None:
        last_known = state.get("completion_percentage", 0)
        logger.warning(f"Parse failure, using last known: {last_known}%")
        return last_known
    return parsed_value
```

**Safety valve:** After 3 consecutive parse failures, reset to 0 to prevent infinite loops.

**Impact:**
- Eliminates wasted cycles from benign parse errors
- Maintains safety with consecutive failure detection
- GitHub Analyzer: Would have prevented Cycle 1 regression

**Status:** ✅ Implemented in StateManager

### 4. Agent Drift Detection ✅

**Problem:** Agents sometimes worked on features outside project scope (scope creep).

**Example:**
```
Goal: "Build a CLI tool"
Agent created: CLI + npm publishing + CI/CD + deployment automation
```

**Solution:** Goal alignment checks every 3 cycles:

```python
if cycle_num > 0 and cycle_num % 3 == 0:
    logger.info(f"GOAL ALIGNMENT CHECK (Cycle {cycle_num})")
    logger.info(f"Original Goal: {self.goal}")
    logger.info("⚠️ Reminder: Ensure all work aligns with original goal!")
```

**Impact:**
- Reduces scope creep
- Keeps agents focused on core requirements
- Improves cycle efficiency

**Status:** ✅ Implemented in orchestrator.py

### 5. State Isolation Between Projects ✅

**Problem:** Residual state from previous projects could contaminate new runs.

**Solution:** Complete state reset on `start-agent`:

```python
def initialize_project(project_dir, goal):
    # Wipe previous state completely
    if state_file.exists():
        state_file.unlink()

    # Create fresh state
    return new_clean_state(project_dir, goal)
```

**Impact:**
- Zero cross-project contamination
- Predictable behavior for each run
- Clean slate for every project

**Status:** ✅ Implemented in StateManager

## Ongoing Improvements

### 6. Environment Dependency Detection 🔄

**Problem:** Agents don't proactively detect language runtime requirements.

**Current behavior:**
```
Goal: "Build a TypeScript CLI"
→ Cycle 0: Try to run tsc → Not found → Fail
→ Cycle 1-7: Various Node.js installation attempts
→ Cycle 8: Finally successful (binary download)
```

**Proposed solution:**
```python
def detect_environment_needs(goal: str) -> dict:
    needs = {
        "nodejs": "typescript" in goal.lower() or "ts" in goal,
        "ruby": "ruby" in goal.lower() or "rails" in goal,
        "rust": "rust" in goal.lower(),
        # ...
    }
    return needs

def setup_environment(needs: dict):
    if needs["nodejs"] and not nodejs_installed():
        install_nodejs()  # With sudo support
```

**Expected impact:**
- Save 5-10 cycles on environment setup
- Zero wasted cycles on missing runtimes
- Proactive dependency installation

**Status:** 🔄 Planned for v2.0

### 7. Monotonic Completion Enforcement 🔄

**Problem:** Completion % can regress without actual code regression.

**Observed regressions:**
```
CSV Analyzer: 93% → 96% → 92% (dropped 4%)
JSON Parser: 88% → 85% → 92%
```

**Proposed solution:**
```python
def enforce_monotonic_completion(new_pct, old_pct):
    if new_pct < old_pct:
        # Allow slight variations (noise)
        if old_pct - new_pct <= 2:
            return old_pct
        # Significant drop - require justification
        logger.warning(f"Completion dropped {old_pct}% → {new_pct}%")
        # Use old unless reviewer explicitly justifies
    return max(new_pct, old_pct)
```

**Expected impact:**
- Smoother completion curves
- Fewer validation resets
- More predictable convergence

**Status:** 🔄 Under consideration

### 8. Adaptive Timeouts 🔄

**Problem:** Later cycles tend to be faster (smaller changes) but use same timeouts as early cycles.

**Observation:**
```
Cycle 0: Executor uses 25 minutes (83% of 30min timeout)
Cycle 2: Executor uses 12 minutes (40% of 30min timeout)
Cycle 5: Executor uses 8 minutes (27% of 30min timeout)
```

**Proposed solution:**
```python
def get_adaptive_timeout(agent: str, cycle: int) -> int:
    base_timeout = AGENT_TIMEOUTS[agent]

    if cycle <= 1:
        return base_timeout  # Full timeout for early cycles

    # Reduce by 20-30% for later cycles
    reduction = min(0.3, (cycle - 1) * 0.1)
    return int(base_timeout * (1 - reduction))
```

**Expected impact:**
- Faster failure detection in later cycles
- Reduced waiting on hung processes
- More efficient resource usage

**Status:** 🔄 Experimental

### 9. Enhanced Logging and Telemetry 🔄

**Problem:** Limited visibility into agent decision-making and performance patterns.

**Proposed enhancements:**
- Structured logging (JSON format option)
- Performance metrics (cycle duration, API latency)
- Decision tracking (why agent chose specific approach)
- Resource monitoring (CPU, memory, disk per phase)

**Example structured log:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-17T14:30:22",
  "cycle": 2,
  "phase": "execution",
  "duration": 892.5,
  "api_calls": 12,
  "completion_before": 88,
  "completion_after": 92,
  "files_modified": 8,
  "tests_passed": 15,
  "tests_failed": 0
}
```

**Expected impact:**
- Better debugging
- Performance analytics
- Optimization opportunities
- Predictive completion estimates

**Status:** 🔄 Design phase

### 10. Multi-Project Queue 🔄

**Problem:** Can only run one project at a time; sequential execution only.

**Proposed solution:**
```bash
# Queue multiple projects
fireteam-queue add ~/project1 "Goal 1"
fireteam-queue add ~/project2 "Goal 2"
fireteam-queue add ~/project3 "Goal 3"

# Start queue processor
fireteam-queue start

# Monitor queue
fireteam-queue status
```

**Expected impact:**
- Batch processing of multiple projects
- Unattended overnight runs
- Better resource utilization

**Status:** 🔄 Future consideration (v2.0+)

### Example Improvement Proposal

```markdown
## Improvement: Intelligent Retry Delays

**Problem:** Fixed 5-second retry delay wastes time on quick failures
but doesn't help with long API outages.

**Observed:**
- Network hiccup: 5sec delay sufficient
- API outage: 5sec useless, need 60+ seconds

**Proposed Solution:**
Exponential backoff: 5s → 15s → 45s

**Expected Impact:**
- Faster recovery from transient issues
- Better handling of prolonged outages
- 30% reduction in wasted retry time

**Testing Plan:**
- Simulate network failures
- Measure retry success rates
- Compare fixed vs. exponential delays
```

## Improvement Metrics

### How We Measure Success

1. **Cycle reduction:** Fewer cycles to same completion %
2. **Time savings:** Faster project completion
3. **Success rate:** More projects reaching ≥90%
4. **Reliability:** Fewer failures and errors
5. **User satisfaction:** Easier to use, better results

### Current Metrics (Post-Improvements)

- ✅ **100% success rate** (11/11 projects ≥90%)
- ✅ **94.1% avg completion** (exceeds 90% target)
- ✅ **3.7 avg cycles** (down from projected 5-6)
