# Types

This page documents the types used by Fireteam.

## ExecutionMode

Enum for execution strategies.

```python
from fireteam import ExecutionMode

class ExecutionMode(Enum):
    SINGLE_TURN = "single_turn"  # Direct Opus call, minimal tools
    SIMPLE = "simple"            # Execute only
    MODERATE = "moderate"        # Execute + single review
    FULL = "full"                # Plan + execute + validation reviews
```

### Values

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `SINGLE_TURN` | Minimal execution for trivial tasks |
| `SIMPLE` | Execute without review |
| `MODERATE` | Execute with single review |
| `FULL` | Plan + execute + multiple validation reviews |

## ComplexityLevel

Enum for task complexity classification.

```python
from fireteam import ComplexityLevel

class ComplexityLevel(Enum):
    TRIVIAL = "trivial"    # Single-line changes
    SIMPLE = "simple"      # Self-contained tasks
    MODERATE = "moderate"  # Multi-file changes
    COMPLEX = "complex"    # Architectural changes
```

### Mapping to ExecutionMode

| ComplexityLevel | ExecutionMode |
|-----------------|---------------|
| `TRIVIAL` | `SINGLE_TURN` |
| `SIMPLE` | `SIMPLE` |
| `MODERATE` | `MODERATE` |
| `COMPLEX` | `FULL` |

## ExecutionResult

Dataclass containing execution results.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from fireteam import ExecutionMode

@dataclass
class ExecutionResult:
    success: bool
    mode: ExecutionMode
    output: str | None = None
    error: str | None = None
    completion_percentage: int = 0
    metadata: dict = field(default_factory=dict)
```

### Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `success` | `bool` | Whether the task completed successfully |
| `mode` | `ExecutionMode` | The execution mode that was used |
| `output` | `str \| None` | Execution output/result text |
| `error` | `str \| None` | Error message if failed |
| `completion_percentage` | `int` | 0-100 completion estimate |
| `metadata` | `dict` | Additional info (plan, review, etc.) |

### Example

```python
from fireteam import execute

result = await execute(
    project_dir="/path/to/project",
    goal="Fix the bug",
)

# Access fields
print(result.success)  # True
print(result.mode)  # ExecutionMode.SIMPLE
print(result.output)  # "Fixed the null pointer exception..."
print(result.completion_percentage)  # 100
print(result.metadata)  # {"review": "...", "plan": "..."}
```

## Hook Types

### Pre-configured Hook Sets

```python
from fireteam.hooks import (
    QUALITY_HOOKS,      # Run tests, block questions
    AUTONOMOUS_HOOKS,   # Block user interaction
    DEBUG_HOOKS,        # Log tool usage
)
```

### Hook Function Signature

```python
async def hook_function(
    event: dict,      # Hook event data
    context: Any,     # Execution context
    config: Any,      # Configuration
) -> dict:
    """
    Returns:
        Empty dict to continue normally
        Dict with hookSpecificOutput to modify behavior
    """
    return {}
```

## Constants

### COMPLEXITY_TO_MODE

Mapping from complexity to execution mode:

```python
from fireteam.api import COMPLEXITY_TO_MODE

COMPLEXITY_TO_MODE = {
    ComplexityLevel.TRIVIAL: ExecutionMode.SINGLE_TURN,
    ComplexityLevel.SIMPLE: ExecutionMode.SIMPLE,
    ComplexityLevel.MODERATE: ExecutionMode.MODERATE,
    ComplexityLevel.COMPLEX: ExecutionMode.FULL,
}
```

### Prompts

System prompts used by Fireteam:

```python
from fireteam.api import EXECUTOR_PROMPT, REVIEWER_PROMPT, PLANNER_PROMPT
from fireteam.complexity import COMPLEXITY_PROMPT
```
