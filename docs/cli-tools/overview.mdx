## Overview

Fireteam provides a suite of command-line tools for starting, stopping, and monitoring autonomous development projects. These tools are installed globally during setup and provide a simple interface to the powerful multi-agent system.

## Available Commands

</CardGroup>

## Installation Location

CLI tools are installed to `~/.local/bin/` during Fireteam setup:

```bash
~/.local/bin/
├── start-agent          # Start a project
├── stop-agent           # Stop running project
├── fireteam-status      # View status and logs
└── agent-progress       # Legacy status command
```

<Tip>
Ensure `~/.local/bin` is in your PATH. The setup script automatically adds this to your shell configuration.
</Tip>

**Verify installation:**

```bash
which fireteam-status
# Output: /home/claude/.local/bin/fireteam-status

fireteam-status --help
```

## Quick Reference

### Starting a Project

```bash
start-agent --project-dir ~/my-project --prompt "Your project goal here"
```

### Checking Status

```bash
# One-time status check
fireteam-status

# Live monitoring (updates every 5s)
fireteam-status --watch

# View logs
fireteam-status --logs
```

### Stopping a Project

```bash
stop-agent
```

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Start and Monitor

```bash
# Start a new project
start-agent --project-dir ~/bitcoin-cli --prompt "Build a Bitcoin price checker CLI using Python"

# Monitor progress in real-time
fireteam-status --watch

# When satisfied, stop (or let it complete)
stop-agent
```

### Workflow 2: Background Execution

```bash
# Start project
start-agent --project-dir ~/api-server --prompt "Build a REST API with FastAPI"

# Check on it later
fireteam-status

# View logs to see what happened
fireteam-status --logs --follow
```

### Workflow 3: Multiple Projects (Sequential)

```bash
# Project 1
start-agent --project-dir ~/project1 --prompt "Goal 1"
# ... wait for completion or stop ...
stop-agent

# Project 2 (fresh state)
start-agent --project-dir ~/project2 --prompt "Goal 2"
```

<Warning>
Fireteam can only run **one project at a time**. Starting a new project while one is running will fail. Use `stop-agent` first.
</Warning>

## Command Features

### Global Flags

All CLI tools support standard behavior:

- **Exit codes**: 0 for success, 1 for error
- **Error output**: Sent to stderr
- **Help text**: Available via `--help` flag

### Shell Completion

Add shell completion for better UX:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc
complete -W "--project-dir --prompt --watch --logs --follow --interval" start-agent fireteam-status
```

```zsh Zsh
# Add to ~/.zshrc
autoload -U compinit
compinit
```

</CodeGroup>

## Environment Integration

### Working Directory

CLI tools work from any directory but operate on specific project directories:

```bash
# Can run from anywhere
cd ~
start-agent --project-dir /home/claude/projects/myapp --prompt "Build app"

# Fireteam works in /home/claude/projects/myapp
```

### Process Management

- **Background execution**: Projects run as background processes
- **PID tracking**: Process ID stored in `orchestrator.pid`
- **Graceful shutdown**: SIGTERM signal for clean exit
- **Automatic cleanup**: Stale PID files removed automatically

### State Isolation

Each project run creates isolated state:

- State stored in `/home/claude/fireteam/state/current.json`
- Completely reset between projects
- No cross-contamination between runs

## Logging

All CLI tools generate logs:

**Orchestrator logs:**
```bash
/home/claude/fireteam/logs/orchestrator_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log
```

**System log (when running in background):**
```bash
/home/claude/fireteam/logs/system.log
```

**View logs:**

```bash
# Show recent entries
fireteam-status --logs

# Follow live
fireteam-status --logs --follow

# Show specific number of lines
fireteam-status --logs --lines 50
```

## Troubleshooting

### Command Not Found

**Problem:** `start-agent: command not found`

**Solution:**

```bash
# Add to PATH
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"

# Make permanent
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Already Running Error

**Problem:** "Agent system is already running"

**Solution:**

```bash
# Stop existing project
stop-agent

# Or check status
fireteam-status

# Force cleanup if needed
rm -f /home/claude/fireteam/orchestrator.pid
```

### Permission Denied

**Problem:** Permission errors when executing commands

**Solution:**

```bash
# Ensure scripts are executable
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/start-agent
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/stop-agent
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/fireteam-status
```

### Stale PID File

**Problem:** Status shows running but nothing is actually running

**Solution:**

CLI tools automatically clean up stale PID files. If issues persist:

```bash
rm -f /home/claude/fireteam/orchestrator.pid
fireteam-status  # Should show STOPPED
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Use Absolute Paths

```bash
# Good
start-agent --project-dir /home/claude/projects/myapp --prompt "Goal"

# Avoid relative paths (can cause issues)
start-agent --project-dir ../myapp --prompt "Goal"
```

### 2. Monitor Progress

<Tip>
Use `fireteam-status --watch` to monitor long-running projects. This helps you understand agent behavior and catch issues early.
</Tip>

### 3. Check Logs for Errors

If a project fails or behaves unexpectedly:

```bash
fireteam-status --logs --lines 100 | grep ERROR
```

### 4. Graceful Shutdown

Always use `stop-agent` instead of `kill`:

```bash
# Good - graceful shutdown
stop-agent

# Avoid - can corrupt state
kill -9 $(cat /home/claude/fireteam/orchestrator.pid)
```

### 5. One Project at a Time

Wait for projects to complete or stop them before starting new ones:

```bash
# Check if running
fireteam-status

# Stop if needed
stop-agent

# Start new project
start-agent --project-dir ~/new-project --prompt "Goal"
```

## Advanced Usage

### Scripting Fireteam

Automate project creation with shell scripts:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# auto-fireteam.sh

# Stop any running project
stop-agent 2>/dev/null || true

# Start new project
start-agent --project-dir "$1" --prompt "$2"

# Wait for completion
while fireteam-status | grep -q "RUNNING"; do
    sleep 30
done

# Show final status
fireteam-status
```

Usage:

```bash
./auto-fireteam.sh ~/my-app "Build a CLI calculator"
```

### Monitoring with Watch

Combine with standard Unix tools:

```bash
# Monitor in terminal split/tmux
watch -n 5 'fireteam-status'

# Alert on completion
while fireteam-status | grep -q "RUNNING"; do sleep 60; done && notify-send "Fireteam Complete"
```

### Log Analysis

Extract useful information from logs:

```bash
# Show all error messages
grep ERROR /home/claude/fireteam/logs/orchestrator_*.log

# Show completion percentages
grep "Completion:" /home/claude/fireteam/logs/orchestrator_*.log

# Count cycles
grep "CYCLE" /home/claude/fireteam/logs/orchestrator_*.log | wc -l
```
