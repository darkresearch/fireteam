title: "start-agent"
description: "Launch new Fireteam projects with autonomous development goals"
---

## Synopsis

```bash
start-agent --project-dir <directory> --prompt <goal>
```

## Description

The `start-agent` command launches a new Fireteam project, initializing the multi-agent system to autonomously build software according to your specified goal. The system runs in the background, executing Plan → Execute → Review cycles until the project reaches 95%+ completion with triple validation.

## Options

### Required Arguments

<ParamField path="--project-dir" type="string" required>
  Absolute path to the project directory. Created if it doesn't exist.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--prompt" type="string" required>
  The project goal/objective. Should be clear, specific, and actionable.
</ParamField>

## Basic Usage

### Simple Project

```bash
start-agent --project-dir ~/calculator --prompt "Build a Python command-line calculator with basic arithmetic operations"
```

### API Project

```bash
start-agent \
  --project-dir ~/api-server \
  --prompt "Create a REST API with FastAPI for managing a todo list. Include CRUD operations, SQLite database, and proper error handling."
```

### TypeScript Project

```bash
start-agent \
  --project-dir ~/github-analyzer \
  --prompt "Build a TypeScript CLI tool that analyzes GitHub repositories and shows contributor statistics using the GitHub API"
```

## Writing Effective Goals

### Goal Structure

A well-written goal should include:

1. **Technology stack** (Python, TypeScript, FastAPI, etc.)
2. **Project type** (CLI, API, web scraper, etc.)
3. **Core features** (what it should do)
4. **Quality requirements** (tests, error handling, documentation)

### Good Goal Examples

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="✅ Excellent: Bitcoin Price Checker">

```
Build a Python CLI application that checks Bitcoin prices using the CoinGecko API.
Include:
- Real-time price fetching
- Support for multiple currencies (USD, EUR, GBP)
- Error handling for API failures
- Formatted output with colors
- Unit tests
```

**Why it's good:**
- Specifies language (Python)
- Defines type (CLI)
- Lists specific features
- Includes quality requirements
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="✅ Good: REST API Server">

```
Create a REST API server using FastAPI for a note-taking application.
Features:
- CRUD endpoints for notes
- SQLite database
- Input validation
- Error responses
- Basic tests
```

**Why it's good:**
- Clear framework (FastAPI)
- Specific functionality (note-taking)
- Technical requirements listed
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="⚠️ Acceptable: Web Scraper">

```
Build a web scraper in Python that gets headlines from Hacker News and saves them to a file
```

**Why it's acceptable:**
- Basic requirements clear
- Missing quality requirements
- Could benefit from more detail
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="❌ Poor: Generic Request">

```
Make me an app
```

**Why it's poor:**
- No technology specified
- No feature definition
- Completely ambiguous
- Will likely produce unsatisfactory results
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

### Goal Writing Tips

<Tip>
**Be specific about the tech stack.** "Build a Python CLI" is better than "Build a CLI" because it prevents the agent from choosing unfamiliar technologies.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Include edge cases and quality requirements.** Mentioning "error handling" and "tests" significantly improves code quality.
</Tip>

<Warning>
**Avoid scope creep.** Don't request deployment automation, npm publishing, or Docker containerization unless specifically needed. Focus on core functionality.
</Warning>

## What Happens When You Start

### 1. Pre-flight Checks

```
✓ Validate arguments
✓ Check for running instances
✓ Ensure project directory accessible
```

### 2. Initialization

```
✓ Create project directory (if needed)
✓ Initialize git repository
✓ Create timestamped branch (agent-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS)
✓ Initialize project state
```

### 3. Background Execution

```
✓ Start orchestrator process
✓ Save PID to orchestrator.pid
✓ Begin Plan → Execute → Review cycles
```

### 4. Confirmation

```
Agent system started (PID: 12345)
Use 'fireteam-status' to check status
Use 'stop-agent' to stop the system
```

## Monitoring Execution

After starting a project, monitor progress:

```bash
# One-time status check
fireteam-status

# Live monitoring
fireteam-status --watch

# View logs
fireteam-status --logs --follow
```

See [fireteam-status](/cli-tools/fireteam-status) for detailed monitoring options.

## Project Directory Structure

Fireteam automatically creates and manages:

```
~/your-project/
├── .git/                    # Git repository (auto-created)
│   └── refs/heads/
│       └── agent-20251017-143022  # Timestamped branch
├── src/                     # Source code (agent-created)
├── tests/                   # Test files (agent-created)
├── requirements.txt         # Python deps (if applicable)
├── package.json            # Node deps (if applicable)
└── README.md               # Documentation (agent-created)
```

## Git Integration

### Automatic Repository Setup

- **New directories**: Git repo initialized automatically
- **Existing repos**: New branch created from current HEAD
- **Branch naming**: `agent-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` format

### Commit Behavior

Each cycle produces a commit:

```
Cycle 0: 85% complete
Cycle 1: 92% complete
Cycle 2: 96% complete
```

### Remote Pushing

If a git remote exists, commits are automatically pushed:

```bash
cd ~/your-project
git remote add origin git@github.com:user/repo.git

# Subsequent cycles automatically push
```

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Weather CLI (2 cycles, 95% completion)

**Command:**
```bash
start-agent \
  --project-dir ~/weather-cli \
  --prompt "Build a Python CLI that fetches weather data from OpenWeatherMap API. Include current weather, 5-day forecast, and temperature in Celsius/Fahrenheit."
```

**Timeline:**
- Cycle 0: Created project structure, API integration, basic features (88%)
- Cycle 1: Added error handling, tests, formatting (95%)
- Validation: Triple-checked, completed

**Result:** Production-ready weather CLI in ~40 minutes

### Example 2: Task Manager (1 cycle, 92% completion)

**Command:**
```bash
start-agent \
  --project-dir ~/task-manager \
  --prompt "Build a Python CLI task manager with SQLite. Support adding, listing, completing, and deleting tasks. Include due dates and priority levels."
```

**Timeline:**
- Cycle 0: Complete implementation with database, CRUD, CLI (92%)
- Validation: Met threshold, completed

**Result:** Fully functional task manager in ~25 minutes (single cycle!)

### Example 3: REST API Server (1 cycle, 92% completion)

**Command:**
```bash
start-agent \
  --project-dir ~/notes-api \
  --prompt "Create a FastAPI REST API for note-taking. Include endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting notes. Use SQLite for storage and include input validation."
```

**Timeline:**
- Cycle 0: Full API with all CRUD endpoints, database, validation, tests (92%)
- Validation: Completed

**Result:** Production-ready API in ~30 minutes (single cycle!)

## Advanced Usage

### Continuing Previous Work

To continue from a specific git commit:

```bash
cd ~/existing-project
git checkout specific-commit

# Fireteam creates new branch from this point
start-agent --project-dir ~/existing-project --prompt "Add feature X"
```

### Template-Based Projects

Start from a template directory:

```bash
cp -r ~/templates/fastapi-template ~/my-api
start-agent --project-dir ~/my-api --prompt "Add user authentication to this FastAPI template"
```

### Multi-Language Projects

```bash
start-agent \
  --project-dir ~/fullstack-app \
  --prompt "Build a full-stack app with Python FastAPI backend and basic HTML/JS frontend for a todo list"
```

<Info>
Multi-language projects take longer (typically 5-7 cycles) due to increased complexity.
</Info>

## Troubleshooting

### "Agent system is already running"

**Cause:** Another project is currently running

**Solution:**

```bash
# Check what's running
fireteam-status

# Stop it
stop-agent

# Try again
start-agent --project-dir ~/new-project --prompt "Goal"
```

### "Permission denied" on project directory

**Cause:** Insufficient permissions

**Solution:**

```bash
# Use directory you own
start-agent --project-dir ~/projects/myapp --prompt "Goal"

# Or fix permissions
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /path/to/project
```

### Process starts but immediately stops

**Cause:** Likely Python or Claude CLI issues

**Solution:**

```bash
# Check logs for errors
fireteam-status --logs

# Verify Python and Claude CLI
python3 --version
claude --version

# Check Claude authentication
claude auth status
```

### Git initialization fails

**Cause:** Git not configured or not installed

**Solution:**

```bash
# Configure git
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"

# Or set in .env
echo 'GIT_USER_NAME=Your Name' >> /home/claude/fireteam/.env
echo 'GIT_USER_EMAIL=you@example.com' >> /home/claude/fireteam/.env
```

## Error Codes

| Code | Meaning | Solution |
|------|---------|----------|
| `0` | Success | Project started |
| `1` | Missing arguments | Provide --project-dir and --prompt |
| `1` | Already running | Stop existing project first |
| `1` | Invalid directory | Check path and permissions |

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Descriptive Project Directories

```bash
# Good - descriptive names
--project-dir ~/bitcoin-price-checker
--project-dir ~/fastapi-todo-api

# Avoid - generic names
--project-dir ~/project1
--project-dir ~/test
```

### 2. Write Goals in Active Voice

```bash
# Good
"Build a CLI that checks Bitcoin prices"

# Less clear
"A Bitcoin price checking CLI should be built"
```

### 3. Specify Testing Requirements

```bash
# Good - includes testing
"Build a calculator with unit tests for all operations"

# Basic - no testing mentioned
"Build a calculator"
```

### 4. Set Realistic Scopes

<Tip>
Projects that complete in 1-3 cycles typically have:
- Clear, focused objectives
- Single primary function
- 200-500 lines of code
- Standard tech stack
</Tip>

Complex projects (5+ cycles):
- Multiple integrated features
- 1000+ lines of code
- Advanced architectures
- Novel tech combinations
