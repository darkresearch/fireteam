## What is Fireteam?

Fireteam is an **autonomous multi-agent software development system** powered by Claude AI. Think of it as your personal 4-person special ops team for coding - working tirelessly in coordinated cycles until your project is complete.

Just like a military fireteam, each agent has a specialized role:

- **Planner**: Strategic thinker who creates and updates project plans
- **Executor**: Hands-on builder who writes actual, working code
- **Reviewer**: Quality control expert who tests and validates progress
- **Orchestrator**: Mission commander who coordinates the cycle

The system runs **continuously and autonomously** until your project reaches 95%+ completion, validated through three consecutive reviews.

## How It Works

```
Orchestrator (Infinite Loop)
    ↓
[Plan] → [Execute] → [Review] → [Git Commit]
    ↑___________________________________|
```

1. **Planning Phase**: Analyzes the goal and creates actionable tasks
2. **Execution Phase**: Implements the tasks with production-ready code
3. **Review Phase**: Tests functionality and estimates completion percentage
4. **Git Commit**: Automatically commits all changes with descriptive messages

This cycle repeats until the Reviewer confirms ≥95% completion three times in a row.

<Info>
The triple-validation system ensures quality. A single high score isn't enough - the project must consistently meet the completion threshold.

## What Can Fireteam Build?

Fireteam excels at creating complete, production-ready projects across various domains:

### Python Projects
- **CLI Tools**: Command-line applications with argument parsing, file I/O
- **APIs**: REST APIs with FastAPI, Flask, including authentication and validation
- **Web Scrapers**: BeautifulSoup-based scrapers with error handling
- **Data Tools**: CSV/JSON analyzers, data processors with pandas
- **Database Apps**: SQLite CRUD applications with proper schema design

### TypeScript/Node.js Projects
- **CLI Tools**: TypeScript command-line applications
- **API Integrations**: GitHub, cryptocurrency, weather, and other API clients
- **Testing Frameworks**: Comprehensive test suites with proper coverage

<Warning>
TypeScript projects may require additional setup time for Node.js installation. Python projects typically complete faster due to pre-installed runtime.
</Warning>

## Real-World Performance

Based on comprehensive testing across 11 diverse projects:

- **100% Success Rate**: All projects reached ≥90% completion
- **94.1% Average Completion**: Exceeds the 90% target threshold
- **3.7 Average Cycles**: Most projects complete in 2-3 cycles
- **Single-Cycle Success**: 27% of projects completed in just one cycle

<Tip>
Check out the [Test Results](/performance/test-results) page for detailed performance metrics and project examples.
</Tip>

## Example Projects

### Bitcoin Price Checker (98% completion, 3 cycles)
A CLI tool that fetches current Bitcoin price from CoinGecko API with:
- API key management
- Rate limiting and retry logic
- Error handling
- Formatted console output

### REST API Server (92% completion, 1 cycle!)
A complete FastAPI note-taking server with:
- Full CRUD operations
- Request validation
- Error handling
- Database integration

### Task Manager CLI (92% completion, 1 cycle!)
A SQLite-based task management system with:
- Database schema design
- CRUD operations
- Command-line interface
- Data persistence

## Why Fireteam?

Traditional AI coding assistants require constant supervision and produce placeholder code. Fireteam is different:

✅ **Truly Autonomous**: Set a goal and walk away. Fireteam runs until completion.

✅ **Production-Ready Code**: No placeholders, no TODOs. Real, working implementations.

✅ **Self-Validating**: The Reviewer agent ensures quality before marking tasks complete.

✅ **Git Native**: Automatic version control means every step is tracked and reversible.

✅ **Battle-Tested**: Proven across 11 diverse projects with 100% success rate.
