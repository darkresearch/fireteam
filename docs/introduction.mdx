# Fireteam

Fireteam is a Python library for adaptive task execution using Claude Agent SDK. It automatically estimates task complexity and selects the appropriate execution strategy.

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How It Works

When you call `execute()`, Fireteam:

1. **Estimates complexity** - Analyzes the goal to determine if it's trivial, simple, moderate, or complex
2. **Selects execution mode** - Maps complexity to the appropriate execution strategy
3. **Executes the task** - Runs the appropriate phases (plan, execute, review)
4. **Returns results** - Provides success status, output, and completion percentage

```python
from fireteam import execute

result = await execute(
    project_dir="/path/to/project",
    goal="Fix the authentication bug",
)

print(f"Success: {result.success}")
print(f"Completion: {result.completion_percentage}%")
```

## Execution Modes

| Complexity | Mode | Phases |
|------------|------|--------|
| TRIVIAL | SINGLE_TURN | Direct execution |
| SIMPLE | SIMPLE | Execute only |
| MODERATE | MODERATE | Execute + review |
| COMPLEX | FULL | Plan + execute + validation reviews |

## When to Use Fireteam

Fireteam is ideal for:

- **Autonomous task execution** - Let Claude complete tasks without constant supervision
- **Complex refactoring** - Multi-file changes with validation
- **Feature implementation** - Plan, implement, and verify new features
- **Bug fixing** - Analyze, fix, and confirm resolution
