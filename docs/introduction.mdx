## What is Fireteam?

Fireteam is a lightweight wrapper around Claude that enables perpetual execution. It's a multi-agent orchestration system we built internally and decided to open-source.

**The problem:** Claude (and other AI assistants) stop when they decide they're "done" - often prematurely. You can't control when they stop or enforce objective completion criteria.

**Our solution:** Fireteam orchestrates four specialized Claude instances in a loop with an objective review system:

- **Planner**: Analyzes the codebase and creates/updates project plans
- **Executor**: Implements code based on the plan
- **Reviewer**: Scores completion percentage (0-100%) against the original goal
- **Orchestrator**: Manages the cycle and enforces completion criteria

The system runs in an infinite loop until it achieves 95%+ completion three consecutive times. This validation requirement prevents premature stopping and enables runs lasting hours, days, or longer.

<Info>
**Why "Fireteam"?** In military terminology, a fireteam is the smallest unit - typically four people. This reflects our minimal multi-agent architecture: four Claude instances working together.

## How It Works

```
Orchestrator (Infinite Loop)
    ↓
[Plan] → [Execute] → [Review] → [Git Commit]
    ↑___________________________________|
```

1. **Planning Phase**: Analyzes the goal and creates actionable tasks
2. **Execution Phase**: Implements code based on the plan
3. **Review Phase**: Scores completion (0-100%) based on the original goal
4. **Git Commit**: Commits all changes
5. **Loop**: Repeat until validation criteria met (default: 3 consecutive cycles ≥95%)

The loop continues indefinitely until the completion threshold is met consistently. With default settings, this means three consecutive reviews scoring ≥95%.

## What Can Fireteam Build?

Fireteam works on projects that Claude can build, but with the ability to iterate over multiple cycles:

### Python Projects
- **CLI Tools**: Command-line applications with argument parsing, file I/O
- **APIs**: REST APIs with FastAPI, Flask, including authentication and validation
- **Web Scrapers**: BeautifulSoup-based scrapers with error handling
- **Data Tools**: CSV/JSON analyzers, data processors with pandas
- **Database Apps**: SQLite CRUD applications with proper schema design

### TypeScript/Node.js Projects
- **CLI Tools**: TypeScript command-line applications
- **API Integrations**: GitHub, cryptocurrency, weather, and other API clients
- **Testing Frameworks**: Comprehensive test suites with proper coverage

<Warning>
TypeScript projects may require additional setup time for Node.js installation. Python projects typically complete faster due to pre-installed runtime.
</Warning>

## Example Projects

### Bitcoin Price Checker
A CLI tool that fetches current Bitcoin price from CoinGecko API with:
- API key management
- Rate limiting and retry logic
- Error handling
- Formatted console output

### REST API Server
A complete FastAPI note-taking server with:
- Full CRUD operations
- Request validation
- Error handling
- Database integration

### Task Manager CLI
A SQLite-based task management system with:
- Database schema design
- CRUD operations
- Command-line interface
- Data persistence

## Key Characteristics

**Perpetual execution:** Runs in an infinite loop until completion criteria are met. We've had runs exceeding 37 hours.

**Configurable stopping criteria:** You set the completion threshold (default: 95%) and validation requirements (default: 3 consecutive passes). The system enforces these objectively.

**Cycle-based validation:** Each cycle produces a completion score (0-100%). Single high scores aren't sufficient - the system requires consistent quality across multiple cycles.

**Git integration:** Every cycle creates a commit, providing a complete history of the development process.

**No placeholder code:** The Reviewer scoring penalizes incomplete implementations, so the system tends to produce working code rather than stubs.
