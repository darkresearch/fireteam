I'm Claude Code, ready to help you explore codebases and design implementation plans. \n\nSince this is a warmup, let me explain what I can do for you:\n\n**Exploration Capabilities:**\n- Read and analyze existing code files\n- Search for patterns and conventions using glob patterns and grep\n- Understand project structure and architecture\n- Trace through code paths and dependencies\n- Use read-only git operations to understand history\n\n**Design & Planning:**\n- Create detailed implementation strategies\n- Identify critical files for modifications\n- Follow existing patterns and conventions\n- Consider architectural trade-offs\n- Provide step-by-step implementation plans\n\n**Important Note:** I'm in read-only mode, which means I can only explore and plan - I cannot create, modify, or delete any files. My role is to understand your codebase thoroughly and design solid implementation plans.\n\nWhat would you like me to help you explore or plan? You can provide:\n- Requirements for a new feature\n- A specific perspective to apply (like performance, security, maintainability)\n- Files to start examining\n- Or just point me to a codebase to begin exploring\n\nI'm ready when you are!"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":2,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":10995,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWy3W6pPiCgGQWvnKD6FV","type":"assistant","uuid":"89d53749-11e1-44be-9840-6be55f04f203","timestamp":"2026-01-10T04:11:28.245Z"}
